Build for rpi2 which is armv6 (not armv7)

Is installed with raspbian, so use
--target arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf

This should work but +- glibc versions...
--target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi

~/.cargo/config
[target.arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi]
linker = "arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc"

[target.arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf]
linker = "arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc"

apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf

# ring hardcodes a different compiler name
ln -s /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc ~/bin/arm-linux-musleabihf-gcc
ln -s /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc ~/bin/arm-linux-musleabi-gcc
